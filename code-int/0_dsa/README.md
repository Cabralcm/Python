# Algorithmic Complexity

## Time and Space
- Time Complexity - The amount of time it takes for an algorithm to solve a given problem (or finish a routine)
- Space Complexity - The amount of space (memory, either primary or secondary, or tertiary) to solve a given problem

1) Types of input - we cannot directly compare in the general case for all algorithms to be A/B tested with every type of input
2) Algorithmic implementation - the same algorithm can be coded in many different ways, as well as optimized for the hardware or by the compiler
3) The program/software running the algorithm should be tested on the exact same hardware and software environment. Even if run on the same machine, the best algorithm might encounter an excessive amount of hardware interrupts. Thus impossible to guarantee the same hardware/software environment will ensure a fair comparison
