# Python

High-level language

Interpreted

High-Level syntax --> Byte code --> machine code

Compared to C++, code is compiled into executable, and then can be executed.

Python compiles the code behind the scenes, we can directly run the code.

Python uses
1) Web Apps
2) Data Science
3) AI
4) Image Processing
5) Operating Systems

Data Type - defines the type and range of values that item can have.

Three main data types
1) Numbers
2) Strings
3) Booleans

Variable - a name to which a value can be *assigned*

Variables are **mutable**

# Naming Convention

`snake_case` vs `camelCase`

# Numbers

Python Numbers --> {Integers, Floating-Point Numbers, Complex Numbers}

Memory for an integer depends on its value. E.g. 0 will take up 24 bytes, and 1 takes up 28 bytes.

# Floating-Point Numbers

Decimal numbers
